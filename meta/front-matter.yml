DrivingQ: Can genetic rescue succeed in bringing a population back from the verge
  of extinction?
EssentialQ: How do we use scientific methods to measure and develop solutions for
  our negative impacts on the world?
LearningObj: |-
  1. Provide examples of variation in genes, traits, and individual survival, and why each is important for a species to persist and evolve.
  2. Summarize how human activities fragment animal populations and how habitat fragmentation limits gene flow, reducing genetic variation.
  3. Predict how increasing genetic variation by introducing new individuals (i.e. by conducting genetic rescue) will impact population size.
  4. Create a logic model showing how genetic rescue occurs; i.e. how the introduction of new individuals to a small, inbred population on the verge of extinction provides needed genetic variation for the population to survive and recover.
  5. Demonstrate understanding of how reduction in both population size and genetic variation in endangered species lead to the "extinction vortex"—the increasing likelihood of small populations to blink out due to low population size and recessive genetics from inbreeding.
  6. Propose a model organism to use for research on species that are endangered or infeasible to study.
  7. Interpret scatter plot data from a model organism (Trinidadian guppies) and compare to related data in an endangered species (Florida panthers) to draw broader conclusions about the effectiveness of genetic rescue.
  8. Assess the potential risks and benefits of genetic rescue for a particular species, and propose a course of action.

Description: |-
  Students learn about genetic rescue, an approach for helping endangered populations recover by introducing closely related individuals from a different population. The lesson is framed around the story of Florida panthers, which are a classic success story for genetic rescue. First, students explore Florida panther recovery through the lens of different stakeholders (ranchers, city-dwellers, and Native Americans), discussing ways that each group may have positive or negative associations with panthers. In Day 2, they then explore different options for helping panthers recovery, discussing pros and cons of genetic rescue, captive breeding, or doing nothing. Day 3 provides necessary scaffolding for a deeper dive into genetic rescue by explaining key concepts in the context of Florida panthers. Students also simulate matings to better understand why inbreeding and recessive traits are so problematic in small populations.

  In Day 4, go deeper into genetic rescue: what can go wrong, and students provide evidence of their understanding of how all the concepts connect through a concept mapping exercise, interspersed with our carefully crafted explainer videos. A key take-home is that even though genetic rescue worked in Florida panthers, it's quite risky to test out conservation strategies on an endangered species. The concluding task is to analyze a table of organisms and their characteristics to determine which would be good models to study the effectiveness of genetic rescue without risking a rare species' extinction. Day 5 builds on this to reveal Dr. Sarah Fitzpatrick's (this lesson's sponsor) research using Trinidadian guppies as a model of genetic rescue. Students then spend much of the class period analyzing real, paired data collected from Florida panthers and guppies. They are asked to compare and label graphs from both species, and synthesize broader conclusions. The lesson leaves open many options for project-based lessons and independent projects.

Extensions: One exciting extension could be to have students investigate map data
  of panther car collision mortality events over time. [This incredible interactive
  web tool](https://geodata.myfwc.com/datasets/florida-panther-mortality/explore?filters=eyJEYXRlIjpbMTQ5Mzk2NDkyNzE4OS41NiwxNjA5NTQ1NjAwMDAwXX0%3D&location=26.491578%2C-81.497011%2C12.39)
  would allow students to conduct an independent investigation of the leading cause
  of Florida panther mortality (car crashes). Students could be asked to develop their
  own recommendation for mitigation (a wildlife overpass, increased signage, or decreased
  speed limit) on specific roadways that show high numbers of collisions.
Background: "This video we created provides a lot of useful background: {vid3}\nThe
  Florida panther is a unique subspecies (**Puma concolor coryi**) of the American
  puma (**Puma concolor**). It's not to be confused with black panthers, which are
  the dark (melanistic) forms of leopards or jaguars. The Florida panther was nearly
  driven to extinction by habitat loss, fragmentation, and targeted hunting. In the
  mid-1990s, there remained only a tiny ~20 individual population of panthers in south
  Florida, and they were highly inbred. They had a lot of recessive genetic abnormalities,
  including visible, superficial traits like: kinked tails and cowlicks in their fur,
  to more significant problems like: cryptorchidism (undescended testicles, causing
  infertility in males) and heart defects. Wildlife managers decided to relocate 8
  female Pumas from Texas (**Puma concolor couguar**) into Florida to introduce needed
  genetic variation. .\n\nStudents will get to analyze 20 years worth of monitoring
  data to assess whether genetic rescue was successful (it was! There are now over
  200 Florida panthers). At the same time, students will compare these results to
  a paired data set in Trinidadian guppies to understand how model organisms can be
  used to answer scientific questions that are difficult to answer in an endangered
  or difficult-to-study species.\n\n#### Related Paper:\n![screenshot of panther study

  study many details of genetic rescue in a model system where we don't have to worry
  about inadvertently driving a species extinct, Dr. Sarah Fitzpatrick and colleagues
  went to Trinidad. They took advantage of previous experiments that had moved guppies
  from a downstream population that had lots of genetic variation into upstream pools
  with only a few, highly inbred fish. We describe this experiment and the incredible
  effort that went into monitoring thousands of wild fish over multiple generations
  in this video: {vid 4}. \nThis experimental genetic rescue was indeed successful,
  and after only a few months, genetic variation increased and the population rebounded
  from around 20 individuals to over 1,000.\n\n#### Related Paper:\n![screenshot of

ConnectionToResearch: 'How do we save endangered species? This lesson deals with one
  option called *genetic rescue*—a conservation strategy that involves moving individuals
  from one population into an endangered population that is highly inbred in order
  to add genetic variation to enable population recovery. Students learn about two
  distinct lines of research: one measuring the success of an attempt to save endangered
  Florida panthers; the other using wild Trinidadian guppies as a model of endangered
  species in order to better understand details of how genetic rescue can succeed
  or fail.'
